      "full": "Denver International Airport (DEN/DIA) has become the subject of numerous interconnected conspiracy theories since its opening in 1995. Conspiracy theorists claim the airport serves as cover for secret underground bunkers, New World Order headquarters, Illuminati facilities, alien bases, or government apocalypse shelters. Proponents point to unusual aspects of the airport including its $4.8 billion cost overrun, mysterious artwork, Masonic dedication capstone, unusual runways said to resemble Nazi symbols, extensive underground facilities, and various architectural oddities."
